    <h1>My research interests</h1>
    <p>When we flip a light switch, we expect the light to go directly from "off" to "on". When we use a dial to turn up the volume while listening to our favorite song, we expect the volume to increase a bit at a time, continuously. I'm interested in how humans, even as young children come to be sensitive to mappings across domains.</p>
    <p>Below is a simple example of this phenomenon. Use each slider to see what happens over time. See how across domains each example increases linearly over time? I'm interested in when and how young children become sensitive to these mappings.</p>
