    <h1>My research interests</h1>
    <p>When we flip a light switch, we expect the light to go directly from "off" to "on". When we use a dial to turn up the volume while listening to our favorite song, we expect the volume to increase a bit at a time, continuously. I'm interested in how humans, even as young children come to be sensitive to mappings across domains.</p>
